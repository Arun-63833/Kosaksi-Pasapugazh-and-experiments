This repository is designed for collaborative learning and data analysis focused on the impact of pesticides and pollution on health over the past 20 years. The data has been collected from various sources like ICRISAT and HMIS, and it is currently in a raw state, awaiting further processing and analysis.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to facilitate collaborative learning through hands-on data analysis and feature engineering. Participants will be assigned specific columns from the dataset, and they will be responsible for performing feature engineering on their assigned columns.

By dividing the work among participants, this project aims to provide a practical learning experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and collaborative coding practices.

## Data Collection

The data used in this project has been collected from the following sources:

- ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics)
- HMIS (Health Management Information System)

The data includes information on pesticide usage, pollution levels, and health records from various regions over the past 20 years.

## Getting Started

1. Participants will be assigned specific columns from the dataset for feature engineering.
2. Each participant will create a new branch in the repository to work on their assigned columns.
3. Participants will perform data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering on their assigned columns using Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts.
4. Once the feature engineering is complete, participants will create a pull request to merge their changes into the main branch.
5. Code reviews and discussions will be conducted to ensure code quality and collaborative learning.
6. After all feature engineering tasks are completed, the team will proceed with further data analysis and modeling.
